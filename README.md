In this notebook, we are going to get familiar with Deep Q Networks. Deep Q Networks are an entension of Reinforcement Learning were we incorporate Deep Neural Networks in our policy enhacement procedure.

We also implement an Agent in an online learning environment, meaning that the agent has no initial memory of the rewards in each state. We go through the environment based on our policy and store the observed rewards and corresponding state in the memory of the agent

Finally, we utilize the Agent in a practical Maze Solving problem. The agent is prompted to iterate the maze from a defined starting point to an ending point, maximing the profit from the total route.
